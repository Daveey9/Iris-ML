# Iris-ML

# Dataset
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set.As an illustration of linear discriminant analysis, consider the use of many measurements in taxonomic issues.
The data set includes 50 samples from each of the three iris species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Each sample was examined for four characteristics: the sepal and petal length and width in centimetres.Fisher created a linear discriminant model to separate the species based on the combination of these four characteristics. 

# Project
Using the iris dataset, create a classification model to predict the species that a flower belongs to. 


# Deployment
I have used  Heroku cloud platform to help host my application online.
